- A web application that automates Covid-19 patient check-ins and informs nurses of patients in urgent need
- The application will send the patients text messages, recieve their response and store their exchange in a database
- Nurses can view the conversation and ask additional questions to the patients
- Our Deep Neural Network examines the patients' answers and highlights patients that are in danger so nurses can treat them first
